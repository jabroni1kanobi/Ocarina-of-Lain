"""Importing a save into the built game, and the saves folder of the game folder.

The game keeps its save in <game>/profile/save/<account>/ (runtime/fs_host.c storage_init). The folder is named after
the local account in <game>/profile/account.uid: 16 bytes, two little-endian 64-bit halves, the low one first; the
name is the high half then the low half, 16 hex digits each (runtime/ov_system.c load_uid). A game that never ran has
no account yet; the import makes one as the game would. Saves are committed through <game>/profile/save-tx/, where
a finished commit (ready-<n>) is newer than save/<account>: an import clears that folder, so the game loads the
imported save.

<game>/saves is the player's side. Import Saves takes a save put there first (its files, or the folder that holds
them); otherwise the player picks a folder. Before the save is replaced it is copied to saves/backup <time>, and a
save taken from saves/ moves to saves/imported <time>, so nothing is lost and nothing is imported twice.

A save folder can come from a Switch save backup (the save's files), an emulator (nested folders named by user and
title ids, gone down while each holds only one folder), another NX2navi game folder or its profile folder (the
account folder inside).

README = '''NX2navi saves folder

To import a save, put it here and select Import Saves in the NX2navi launcher (next to Game Folder):
- the files of a Switch save backup, or the folder that holds them
- an emulator's save folder for the game
- the profile folder (or the whole game folder) of another NX2navi install

You can also select Import Saves and choose the folder instead.

Before a save is imported, the game's current save is copied here into a folder named "backup" and the date. An
imported save moves into a folder named "imported" and the date. The game itself keeps its save in profile\\save.
