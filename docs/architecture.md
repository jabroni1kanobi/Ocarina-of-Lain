# Architecture

How the Switch 2 build of *Ocarina of Time* (game version 1.1.1) becomes a native Windows x86-64 program. Code taken
from other projects, with its license, is listed in [THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md](../THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md).

## Pipeline

### 1. Input

- The ExeFS and RomFS of the user's own dump. Everything extracted or generated stays under `build/`, `generated/` or
  the user's own folders, never in the repository (`tools/check_content.py`).

### 2. CPU: lift ARM64 to C

- Modules: `main`, `sdk` and the `subsdk*` modules. `rtld` is dropped; the host links the modules.
- A hand-written decoder (`recomp/lifter.py`) and NEON/FP lowering (`recomp/simd_c.py`, `runtime/simd.h`) emit one C
  function per guest function, direct calls for `BL` and an address-keyed table for indirect branches.
  - The generator runs in parallel processes, with bounded memory per worker.
  - Jump tables are resolved by a symbolic pass of our own (`recomp/jumptables.py`).
  - `LDXP`/`STXP` (128-bit exclusive pairs) are supported.
  - NZCV and the six most used general registers of each function live in C locals instead of the `Cpu`
    (`recomp/flags.py`, `recomp/regs.py`): registers are stored back where they changed, before calls, SVCs and
    exits, and reloaded after them. A call reloads only X0-X18 and X30, as AAPCS64 has the callee preserve X19-X29
    and SP; `gen.py --no-callee-saved-trust` reloads those too.
- Memory: guest address equals host address, all below 2^39 (IPC encodes 39-bit addresses). The heap, stacks and the
  alias region are reserved with `MEM_WRITE_WATCH`, so the graphics back end can ask which pages the CPU wrote since
  the last upload (`runtime/memory.c`).
- Indirect branches go through `rt_dispatch` (`runtime/dispatch.c`), which looks the target up in the address table
  and tail-calls it.
- Testing: a differential harness checks every lifted instruction class against Unicorn (test-only, never linked into
  the game).

### 3. Host

- The SDK boundary is at the `nn::*` function level: threads and synchronisation, IPC, memory, fs/RomFS, time,
  account, applet, hid, audio renderer and effects run as host code. Only `audren:u` and `sm:` are real IPC services.
- Window, keyboard and mouse: Win32 (`gfx_window_win.c`, `input_win.c`). Gamepads and audio output: SDL3 (every
  connected gamepad is open; the game reads the one pressed last, `input.c`). Voice: libopus. Movies: a host VP9
  decoder over libvpx replaces the SDK's `movie::Decoder` (`runtime/ov_movie.c`).
- Settings and menu: every key with its default is in one table (`cfg.c`), read from `nx2navi.ini` and `NX2NAVI_*`
  variables and written back when the in-game menu changes it. The menu and the performance overlay are Dear ImGui,
  drawn into the swapchain image (`runtime/ui/`); their text is in `ui_text.c`.
- OS calls the host makes go through `runtime/platform/` (`platform.h`, `win32.c`).

#### Threads and cores

Every guest thread is a host thread. The game assumes Horizon's scheduler: three application cores, a thread runs
only on a core in its affinity mask, and a higher-priority thread takes a core from a lower-priority one. The game
keeps per-core data without locks and relies on that, so the host models it (`runtime/kernel.c`):

- Three virtual cores. A guest thread runs guest code only while it holds a core; the others wait in a
  priority-ordered list.
- Preemption. When a waiting thread has a better priority than a holder on a core it may use, exactly one holder is
  flagged. The holder checks the flag at its next SVC and at every indirect call (`rt_dispatch`), checks again under
  the kernel lock that a better thread still waits, and only then hands its core over.
- Asynchronous preemption (on unless `NX2NAVI_ASYNC_PREEMPT=0`): a waiter that has spun 250 us suspends the holder
  and, if its host rip is in lifted code at host depth 0, moves it to `kern_ap_stub`, which saves the volatile
  registers and gives the core up there. A holder of a guest mutex counts at the priority of its best waiter, and one
  inside an SDK spin lock is not preempted.
- Host work gives the core back. Queue submits, presents, GPU waits, shader translation, `nn::fs` calls and NVN memory
  pool setup run without a core (`NVN_BLOCKING`, `kern_core_away`).
- Spin waits. Loops that only another thread can end send their back-edges through `rt_spin_gate`, which pauses the
  core once per pass and hands it to a waiter after 50 us of polling (`NX2NAVI_SPIN`, `NX2NAVI_SPIN_HANDOFF_US`).

### 4. Graphics

- NVN 2 front end (`nvn_api_*.c`, `nvn_obj.h`, texture layout and deswizzle, the Switch 2 GOB layout). The game
  records command buffers through it; nothing reaches the GPU until the game submits.
- Vulkan 1.3 back end. At `QueueSubmitCommands` the recorded NVN commands are replayed into Vulkan command buffers on
  the submitting thread (`vk_exec*.c`); a recorder thread makes the `vkCmd*` calls from a ring of packets
  (`vk_rec.c`).
- Memory pools are imported as host memory (`VK_EXT_external_memory_host`). On a discrete GPU, pools bound as buffers
  are mirrored in device-local memory and the pages the CPU wrote (write watch) plus the ranges the game flushes are
  uploaded before a replay (`vk_memory.c`); without the mirrors the GPU reads them over PCIe and Kokiri Forest runs at
  7 fps. GPU-rendered textures are written back when the CPU reads them.
- Uniform snapshot. The game rewrites per-object uniform blocks soon after it submits the frame that reads them; at
  the start of a submission's replay every uniform range it binds from CPU-written pools is copied, and the draws bind
  the copy (`vk_usnap.c`).
- Driver data. The NVN driver keeps a per-stage constant bank (c0). The back end fills it as the driver does: storage
  and uniform tables, push constants and, for NVN 2 compute, the dispatch's group counts in bytes 0-0xb.
- Storage buffers the shaders reach through pointer tables in memory are bound at the address the table holds
  (`GfxShaderRes.ptr`, `vk_exec_draw.c ptr_addr`).
- Bindless textures: the texture and sampler pools are descriptor arrays kept in step with the game's pool writes
  (`vk_exec_draw.c pool_sync`); slots that resolve alike share one lookup.
- Shaders: Ampere (SM86) code is lowered to Maxwell (`tools/xlate/AmpereLowering.cs`) and translated to SPIR-V by the
  pinned shader translator (`tools/vendor/ryujinx`, 1.3.2) with our patches (`tools/xlate/patches/`), built with .NET 10 NativeAOT as
  `nx2navi_xlate.exe` and run as separate processes. Translations are cached on disk; shaders and pipelines seen in
  play are prepared at the next boot. The game waits for it (`runtime/boot.c` `boot_wait`): about half a second
  when warm; after a translator, GPU or driver change a "Preparing shaders" screen shows the progress (`ui/menu.cpp`
  `menu_boot_frame`). With the graphics pipeline library the boot builds recorded pipelines in record order for at
  most 20 s after the shaders are ready and leaves the rest to the pipeline workers below normal priority; a draw
  that meets one before it is built gets a fast-linked pipeline (`vk_pipeline.c` `PREWARM_PIPE_MS`).
  `NX2NAVI_PREWARM_FULL=1`, and drivers without the library, wait for every pipeline. `NX2NAVI_PREWARM_WAIT_MS` caps
  the whole wait, after which the rest finishes in the background.
- Mesh and task shaders run as `VK_EXT_mesh_shader`; indirect mesh draws read NVN's `{count, first}` record through a
  ring of Vulkan `{x, y, z}` records filled on the GPU.
- Pipelines: `VK_EXT_graphics_pipeline_library` where the driver has it: stage libraries compiled ahead, a fast link
  at a new state, an optimised pipeline replacing it from a background thread. A draw whose pipeline is not ready is
  skipped when one of its pass's targets was rendered in the previous frame, and waits otherwise. Compute pipelines
  are compiled outside the pipeline lock, and one compile serves every thread that needs it.
- The game's tensor-core upscaler is replaced by a decode-and-scale pass (`vk_tonemap.c`); `vk_fsr.c` runs AMD FSR 1
  (EASU, RCAS) on the present when the window is larger than the picture.
- ASTC textures are uploaded as they are where the device samples ASTC, and decoded by a compute shader everywhere
  else (`vk_astc.c`); under 20 GiB of video memory the decoder encodes them to BC3.
- Occlusion queries never block the CPU; a result that is not ready counts as visible.
- Allocation: Vulkan Memory Allocator. Debugging: Vulkan validation layers, per-pass frame dumps (`NX2NAVI_DUMP`,
  `vk_dump.c`), a sampling profiler (`NX2NAVI_PROFILE`, `tools/prof_report.py`) and a flight recorder
  (`NX2NAVI_FLIGHT`). RenderDoc cannot capture, because it hides `VK_EXT_external_memory_host` from the application.

Maxwell behaviour the back end has to match: [maxwell.md](maxwell.md).

### 5. Toolchain

- Generated C: MSYS2 UCRT64 Clang + LLD. The generated code uses GNU extensions (`__int128`, `musttail`, vector
  types) that `cl.exe` cannot compile.
- Host code: the same Clang, C11.
- Builds write a Ninja file and run MSYS2 Ninja. Every object is hashed before linking, because a faulty RAM module
  once flipped bits in stored objects.
